# Unity_Tutorial_Solo_Build
Watched all of the first unit of a unity tutorial, teaching the user basics of C# with unity. I then went and made the project myself, this is the result. Can't even call it a game, but hey...ya know. You can play the "game" in the link provided. Don't go sharing the link either, those aren't my assets.
